UX design / Design Evaluation

#### Mode switch for new users
Samsung Galaxy series supported 'Starter mod' UI to provide easy to use interface layout for those who start using Galaxy phones for the first time, or prefers simple UI layout. I oversaw design process and updated flow, terminology and screen elements to be displayed. Starter mode also worked for again generation since it provides fewer screen elements, bigger font and easier to manage.

#### Starter mode
When switched to starter mode, it only supports 3 home screens - favorite contacts, main home with minimum applications, application tray with basic applications. Settings page also support only core elements for using phones.
