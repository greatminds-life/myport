UX design / UX Evaluation
<!--more-->

#### Concept evaluation and design
'Smartr' solution was a solution aiming to create contact list automatically by parsing communication history from email, call log. Based on past communication history, it targeted to provide contact list sorted by relationship. I worked on evaluating this concept in terms of usability and business value as well as design integration into TouchWiz UX platform to estimate expected LOE for engineering team. It helped me to look at UX as a platform and pattern perspective.
