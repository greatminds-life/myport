UX design / Marketing
<!--more-->

#### Motivation
As NJ UX team lead, I got a chance to join marketing campaign with sales team at multiple locations of stores where display Samsung Galaxy series. To my surprise, smartphones displayed for user trial in the stores didn't have any promotional content on them and configuration was randomly changed by visitors and left unmanaged. I thought this is serious loss of opportunity to convince potential customers to explore the best experience of Samsung Galaxy series. In order to address this, I convinced HQ management to kick off a project to provide better first time experience for Samsung Galaxy series at stores. Main goal of this project was to provide best content(photo, music, video, sample contact list, sample text messages, sample calendar events, how to tutorials, etc) and develop dedicated software for Verizon devices.

#### Implimentation
We collaborated marketing team to prepare preloaded content and engineering team to support dedicated software for devices to be displayed in stores. This software can be installed OTA as needed. Basic concept of the in-store mode software were:
> in store smartphone should be pre configured to demonstrate the full potential of Galaxy devices while allow visitors freely change and explore them.
> in store smart phone should provide promotional content.
> in store smartphone should automatically reset to default configuration overnight to provide brand new experience everyday.
These UX requirements were implemented as 'in store software' to be installed on Samsung Galaxy series in retail stores
