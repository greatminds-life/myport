UX Process / UX Evaluation
<!--more-->

#### Innovation process
In order to systematically improve TouchWiz UX platform, I defined 212 core use cases across 14 basic features and ran through them for every new deice development cycle to identify any usability issues. Also, collected user feedback from user trial and testing as well as requests from US carriers. Issues collected were filtered by its severity in terms of usability and business impact. Then design alternatives were prepared and communicated with stake-holders to create TouchWiz UX evolution backlog.

After first iteration of issue filtering, design alternatives were compiled along with underlying usability issue and suggested directions and communicated with stake holders - HQ design, engineering and product owners.
