#### Design
Setup wizard aims to help users to configure smartphones properly without any confusion later. Verizon wireless had its own set of requirements regarding setup wizard while Samsung had its own flow. I worked with engineering team and Verizon UX team to provide the flow compliant to the requirement while leveraging Samsung setup flow and design patterns.
