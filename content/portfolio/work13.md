#### Motivation
Bloomberg mobile app provides capability of listening audio clips associated to a security such as earnings calls. Once it is being played, it should indicate the currently playing audio clip by showing audio bar globally. However, engineering team didn't have bandwidth to support globally accessible audio player at the moment, we needed to indicate where to find the currently playing audio is located. In order to address this issue, I suggested to indicate equalizer indicator on screen elements and menu icon on bottom tab bar. Engineering team and product owner all agreed that this was good solution require much less engineering resource compared to implementing global player bar on every screens. 
* Equalizer indicator is shown on the elements of audio clip and associated navigation links.
* On menu tab, bar player is displayed on top of the menu grid.
* 'Stop' will dismiss equalizer indicator.
