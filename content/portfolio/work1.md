UX design / Strategy / Communication

#### TouchWiz UX design
TouchWiz is UX platform of Samsung smartphones and it is constantly evolving for better usability and user value. I worked on core TouchWiz design including home screen layout and management scheme as well as native application design from the very first Galaxy S series.

#### Customization strategy
Major wireless carriers in US carry their own set of UX requirements which often times conflict Samsung TouchWiz design and strategy. Along the line of TouchWiz evolution, I prepared UX customization strategy under the understanding of their requirement, minimizing the impact on TouchWiz platform evolution. Some requirements from carrier worth considering were escalated to management and made into TouchWiz evolution plan. 
Presented TouchWiz evolution and customization plan to carrier's management team during quarterly roadmap meeting to get buy from them in advance before they select device roadmap for the next quarter.
